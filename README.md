## Travel Site

This is a travel agency site that was built using Gulp task runner, PostCSS plugins and jQuery. This project is incomplete and is not going to receive any future update. Possibly there will be a travel-site v2.0 with more modern tech stack along [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow)course on Udemy. But this repository is going to be archived.
